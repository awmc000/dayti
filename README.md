daily production skills practice HSK1-6

## Concept

concept I had for a fairly simple web app to improve our Chinese production (speaking, writing) skills. Mine are quite lacking. I can understand more when reading than I can construct on the fly when writing.

The goal would be to create a daily routine for the user where they either open the site or get an SMS from the application asking them today's question or responding to today's prompt in their bracket and saving their response. Eg.:

HSK1：今天天气怎么样？
HSK2：你最喜欢听什么音乐？
HSK3：你多长时间买一次新手机？上次是为什么？
HSK4：你讲个尴尬故事吧。

The website would ask users a question in each HSK category each day, and accept responses in text or audio, filtered for abuse etc. We could show some analytics about how people responded, even use LLMS/ML/sentiment analysis.
